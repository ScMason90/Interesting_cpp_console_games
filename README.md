## 📚 Background & Learning Notes

### **Algorithm Practice Phase (Early 2025 → Mid‑2025)**

From early 2025, I spent several months studying data structures and algorithms, followed by nearly half a year of problem‑solving practice. I could complete easier problems independently, while medium and higher‑difficulty ones often required referencing editorial solutions and re‑implementing them for learning.

I also keep a complete archive of my algorithm‑practice work on my local machine, including categorized directories and detailed solution files. Most problems were solved in C, C++, or Python, and for some I explored multiple languages or multiple solution strategies.

### **Transition to C++ Projects (September 2025)**

In September, I shifted my focus toward C++ projects and gradually stepped away from algorithm practice.  
Personally, I feel that solving problems purely for the sake of solving them contributes little to real programming, engineering practice, or project development—unless one is specifically preparing for major tech‑company interviews. This is only my personal perspective.

As one of my instructors said, *“Building projects is far more engaging than grinding algorithm problems.”*
