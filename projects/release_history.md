Reproduction Timeline (Legacy Release Folder Notes)
This document records the historical timeline of my early reproductions of C++ console game projects based on tutorials by javidx9 (OneLoneCoder).
These notes were originally written for my local Release folders and are preserved here as part of my learning history.

Temporarily paused further reproductions of javidx9’s C++ projects.

Note
These entries reflect the state of my local Release folders at the time.
The new repository structure no longer uses Release folders, but this timeline is preserved for archival purposes.
